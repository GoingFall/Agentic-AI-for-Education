    > **Figure P2.4-1**
    > - t range: -1 to 1

1.  Find the signal \(x[n]\) such that \(Ev\{x[n]\}=y[n]\) for \(n ≥0\), and \(Od\{x[n]\}=y[n]\) for \(n<0\)
2.  Suppose that \(Ev\{w[n]\}=y[n]\) for all \(n\). Also assume that \(w[n]=0\) for \(n<0\). Find \(w[n]\)

### P2.6
1.  Sketch \(x[n]=\alpha^{n}\) for a typical \(\alpha\) in the range \(-1<\alpha<0\)
2.  Assume that \(\alpha=-e^{-1}\) and define \(y(t)\) as \(y(t)=e^{\beta t}\). Find a complex number \(\beta\) such that \(y(t)\) when evaluated at \(t\) equal to an integer \(n\), is described by \((-e^{-1})^{n}\)
3.  For \(y(t)\) found in part (b), find an expression for \(\operatorname{Re}\{y(t)\}\) and \(\operatorname{Im}\{y(t)\}\). Plot \(\operatorname{Re}\{y(t)\}\) and \(\operatorname{Im}\{y(t)\}\) for \(t\) equal to an integer.

### P2.7
Let \(x(t)=\sqrt{2}(1+j) e^{j \pi / 4} e^{(-1+j 2 \pi) t}\). Sketch and label the following:
1.  \(\operatorname{Re}\{x(t)\}\)
2.  \(\operatorname{Im}\{x(t)\}\)
3.  \(x(t+2)+x^{*}(t+2)\)

### P2.8
Evaluate the following sums:
1.  $$\sum_{n=0}^{5} 2\left(\frac{3}{a}\right)^{n}$$
2.  $$\sum_{n=2}^{6} b^{n}$$
3.  $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{2 n}$$

**Hint**: Convert each sum to the form
$$C \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \alpha^{n}=S_{N} \quad \text{or} \quad C \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \alpha^{n}=S_{\infty}$$
and use the formulas
$$S_{N}=C\left(\frac{1-\alpha^{N}}{1-\alpha}\right), S_{\infty}=\frac{C}{1-\alpha} \quad \text{for } |\alpha|<1$$

### P2.9
1.  Let \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) be periodic signals with fundamental periods \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) respectively. Under what conditions is the sum \(x(t)+y(t)\) periodic, and what is the fundamental period of this signal if it is periodic?
2.  Let \(x[n]\) and \(y[n]\) be periodic signals with fundamental periods \(N_{1}\) and \(N_{2}\) respectively. Under what conditions is the sum \(x[n]+y[n]\) periodic, and what is the fundamental period of this signal if it is periodic?
3.  Consider the signals
    $$x(t)=\cos \frac{2 \pi t}{3}+2 \sin \frac{16 \pi t}{3}$$
    $$y(t)=\sin \pi t$$
    Show that \(z(t)=x(t) y(t)\) is periodic, and write \(z(t)\) as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials. That is, find a number \(T\) and complex numbers \(c_{k}\) such that
    $$z(t)=\sum_{k} c_{k} e^{j k(2 \pi / T) t}$$

### P2.10
In this problem we explore several of the properties of even and odd signals.
1.  Show that if \(x[n]\) is an odd signal, then
    $$\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} x[n]=0$$
2.  Show that if \(x_{1}[n]\) is an odd signal and \(x_{2}[n]\) is an even signal, then \(x_{1}[n] x_{2}[n]\) is an odd signal.
3.  Let \(x[n]\) be an arbitrary signal with even and odd parts denoted by
    $$x_{e}[n]=E v\{x[n]\}, x_{o}[n]=O d\{x[n]\}$$
    Show that
    $$\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} x^{2}[n]=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} x_{e}^{2}[n]+\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} x_{o}^{2}[n]$$
4.  Although parts (a)-(c) have been stated in terms of discrete-time signals, the analogous properties are also valid in continuous time. To demonstrate this, show that
    $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x^{2}(t) d t=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x_{e}^{2}(t) d t+\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x_{o}^{2}(t) d t$$
    where \(x_{e}(t)\) and \(x_{o}(t)\) are, respectively, the even and odd parts of \(x(t)\)

### P2.11
Let \(x(t)\) be the continuous-time complex exponential signal \(x(t)=e^{j \omega_{0} t}\) with fundamental frequency \(\omega_{0}\) and fundamental period \(T_{0}=2 \pi / \omega_{0}\). Consider the discrete-time signal obtained by taking equally spaced samples of \(x(t)\). That is, \(x[n]=x(n T)=e^{j \omega_{0} n T}\)
1.  Show that \(x[n]\) is periodic if and only if \(T / T_{0}\) is a rational number, that is, if and only if some multiple of the sampling interval exactly equals a multiple of the period \(x(t)\)
2.  Suppose that \(x[n]\) is periodic, that is, that
    $$\frac{T}{T_{0}}=\frac{p}{q}$$
    where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers. What are the fundamental period and fundamental frequency of \(x[n]\)? Express the fundamental frequency as a fraction of \(\omega_{0} T\)
3.  Again assuming that \(T / T_{0}\) satisfies the above equation, determine precisely how many periods of \(x(t)\) are needed to obtain the samples that form a single period of \(x[n]\)
