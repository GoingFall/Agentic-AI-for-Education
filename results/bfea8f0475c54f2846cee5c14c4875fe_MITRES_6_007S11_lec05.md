# 5 Properties of Linear, Time-Invariant Systems
In this lecture we continue the discussion of convolution and in particular explore some of its algebraic properties and their implications in terms of linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems. The three basic properties of convolution as an algebraic operation are that it is commutative, associative, and distributive over addition. The commutative property means simply that x convolved with h is identical with h convolved with x The consequence of this property for LTI systems is that for a system with a specified input and impulse response, the output will be the same if the roles of the input and impulse response are interchanged. The associative property specifies that while convolution is an operation combining two signals, we can refer unambiguously to the convolution of three signals without concern about how they are grouped pairwise.

As demonstrated in the lecture, the associative property combined with the commutative property leads to an extremely important property of LTI systems. Specifically, if we have several LTI systems cascaded together, the output generated by an input to the overall cascade combination does not depend on the order in which the systems are cascaded. This property of LTI systems plays an extremely important role in system design, implementation, and analysis. It is generally not true for arbitrary systems that are not linear and time-invariant, and it represents one very important consequence of exploiting the properties of linearity and time invariance. The distributive property states that a signal convolved with the sum of two signals is identical to the result of carrying out the convolution with each signal in the sum individually and then summing the result. The consequence of this for the interconnection of LTI systems is that a parallel combination can be collapsed into a single system whose impulse response is the sum of the two individual ones. In looking at and understanding the algebraic properties of convolution, it is worthwhile to recognize that convolution as an algebraic property relates to addition in exactly the same way that multiplication relates to addition: that is, multiplication is commutative, associative, and distributive over addition.

In Lecture 3 we defined system properties in addition to linearity and time invariance, specifically properties of memory, invertibility, stability, and causality. While these properties are independent of linearity and time invariance, for LTI systems they can be related to properties of the system impulse response. For example, if an LTI system is memoryless, then the impulse response must be a scaled impulse. If a system with impulse response h is invertible, then the impulse response $h_{i}$ of the inverse system has the property that h convolved with $h_{i}$ is an impulse. For LTI systems an equivalent condition to stability is that the impulse response be absolutely summable (discrete time) or absolutely integrable (continuous time). If an LTI system is causal, then its impulse response must be zero for $t$ (or $n$) $<0$; furthermore, if the impulse response has this property, then the system is guaranteed to be causal.

In the process of discussing these properties for LTI systems, we discuss another very important consequence of linearity-the fact that for a linear system (whether or not it is time-invariant), if the input is zero for all $t$ (or $n$) then the output is zero also.

In this lecture we illustrate the properties discussed above with some systems. The problems associated with this lecture provide the opportunity to explore these properties further.

In Lecture 3 in discussing the continuous-time impulse function, we indicated some inherent difficulty with defining the impulse simply as the limiting form of a rectangular pulse. We also suggested that the important properties of impulses relate not to what they are at each instant of time but to how they behave under integration. Specifically, in the context of signal and system analysis, the important property of impulses and what we call higher-order singularity functions is not what they are but what they do under convolution. This operational definition of impulses and derivatives of impulses is briefly touched on at the end of this lecture.

### Convolution Sum
$$x[n]=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} x[k] \delta[n-k]$$
$$y[n]=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty} x[k] h[n-k]=x[n] * h[n]$$

### Convolution Integral
$$x(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x(\tau) \delta(t-\tau) d \tau$$
$$y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x(\tau) h(t-\tau) d \tau=x(t) * h(t)$$

## TRANSPARENCY 5.2
**The commutativity property of convolution**
$$x[n] * h[n]=h[n] * x[n]$$
$$x(t) * h(t)=h(t) * x(t)$$

Example verifications:
$$u[n] * \alpha^{n} u[n]=\alpha^{n} u[n] * u[n]$$
$$u(t) * e^{-a t} u(t)=e^{-a t} u(t) * u(t)$$

## TRANSPARENCY 5.3
**Three algebraic properties of convolution**
1. **Commutative**
   $$x * h=h * x$$
2. **Associative**
   $$x *\left\{h_{1} * h_{2}\right\}=\left\{x * h_{1}\right\} * h_{2}$$
3. **Distributive**
   $$x *\left\{h_{1}+h_{2}\right\}=x * h_{1}+x * h_{2}$$

## TRANSPARENCY 5.4
**An interpretation of the commutativity property**
- Commutative: $y = x*h$ and $y = h*x$
- LTI System: output is the same if input and impulse response are interchanged

## TRANSPARENCY 5.5
**One consequence of the algebraic properties of convolution is that LTI systems can be cascaded in any order**
- Associative property application:
  - $x \to h_1 \to x*h_1 \to h_2 \to (x*h_1)*h_2$
  - $x \to h_1*h_2 \to x*(h_1*h_2)$
- Commutative property application:
  - $x \to h_2*h_1 \to x*(h_2*h_1)$
  - $x \to h_2 \to x*h_2 \to h_1 \to (x*h_2)*h_1$

## TRANSPARENCY 5.6
**One consequence of the distributive property of convolution is that LTI systems in parallel can be collapsed into a single LTI system**
- Parallel system structure:
  - $x \to h_1 \to x*h_1$
  - $x \to h_2 \to x*h_2$
  - Combined system: $x \to h_1+h_2 \to x*(h_1+h_2)=x*h_1+x*h_2$

## MARKERBOARD 5.1
### Memory
- Linear system property: If $x(t)=0$ for all $t$, then $y(t)=0$ for all $t$
- Invertibility: $y = x + (h*R_i) = x$ implies $h*R_i = \delta$, where $R_i=R^{-1}$
- Convolution integral basis: $y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x(\tau) h(t-\tau) d \tau$

### Key LTI System Property Relations
1. **Memoryless LTI System**
   - Condition: $h(t)=k\delta(t)$ (continuous-time), $h[n]=k\delta[n]$ (discrete-time)
   - Input-output relation: $y(t)=kx(t)$, $y[n]=kx[n]$
   - Linearity verification: $a x(t) \to a y(t)$
2. **Stable LTI System**
   - Discrete-time condition: $\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}|h[k]| < \infty$

## MARKERBOARD 5.2
### Causality
#### Causality Definition for LTI Systems
- If $x_1(t)=x_2(t)$ for $t < t_0$, then $y_1(t)=y_2(t)$ for $t < t_0$
- Impulse response condition: $h(t)=0$ for $t<0$ (continuous-time), $h[n]=0$ for $n<0$ (discrete-time)

#### Linear System Causality Implication
- If $x(t)=0$ for $t < t_0$, then $y(t)=0$ for $t < t_0$ (same for discrete-time)

#### Continuous-Time Convolution Integral for Causality Analysis
$$y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) h(t-\tau) d \tau$$

#### Example: Discrete-Time Accumulator
- System input-output relation: $y[n]=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{n} x[k]$
- Impulse response: $h[n]=u[n]$
- Property analysis:
  - $h[n] \neq k\delta[n] \implies$ not memoryless
  - $h[n]=0$ for $n<0 \implies$ causal
  - $\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}|h[n]|=\infty \implies$ not stable
- Recursive form: $y[n] = y[n-1] + x[n]$

## MARKERBOARD 5.3
### Inverse of Accumulator
- Accumulator impulse response: $h[n]=u[n]$
- Inverse system condition: $u[n] * h_i[n] = \delta[n]$
- Derivation basis: $u[n]-u[n-1]=\delta[n]$
- Inverse system input-output relation: $x_2[n]-x_2[n-1]=y_2[n]$
- Inverse system impulse response: $h_i[n]=\delta[n]-\delta[n-1]$

### Example 1: Discrete-Time LTI System from Difference Equation
- Difference equation: $y[n]-a y[n-1]=x[n]$ (initial rest condition)
- Impulse response: $h[n]=a^n u[n]$
- Property analysis targets: memoryless, causal, stable

### Example 2: Continuous-Time LTI System from Differential Equation
- Differential equation: $\frac{d y(t)}{d t}+2 y(t)=x(t)$ (initial rest condition)
- Impulse response: $h(t)=e^{-2t}u(t)$
- Property analysis target: stability

## MARKERBOARD 5.4
### Singularity Functions and Convolution
1. **Impulse Convolution Property**
   $$\delta(t) * \delta(t)=\delta(t)$$
   $$\delta(n) * \delta(n)=\delta(n)$$
2. **Impulse Limiting Definition**
   $$\delta(t)=\lim _{\Delta \to 0} r_{0}(t)$$
3. **Unit Doublet Convolution Property**
   - Unit doublet notation: $u_1(t)$
   - Convolution effect: $x(t) * u_1(t)=\frac{d x(t)}{d t}$
4. **Higher-Order Singularity Functions**
   - Second-order unit singularity function: $u_2(t)=u_1(t) * u_1(t)$
   - Convolution effect: $x(t) * u_2(t)=\frac{d^{2} x(t)}{d t^{2}}$

## MARKERBOARD 5.5
> **Note**: $\frac{d^{k} x(t)}{d t}$ should read $\frac{d^{k} x(t)}{d t^{k}}$ in both occurrences.

### Singularity Function Hierarchy
1. **Higher-Order Derivative Singularity Functions**
   $$u_{k}(t)=\underbrace{u_{1}(t) * u_{1}(t) * \cdots * u_{1}(t)}_{k \text{ times}}$$
   $$x(t) * u_{k}(t)=\frac{d^{k} x(t)}{d t^{k}}$$
2. **Integral Singularity Functions**
   - $m$-th running integral notation: $u_{-m}(t)$
   - Convolution effect: $x(t) * u_{-m}(t)$ corresponds to $m$-th running integral of $x(t)$
3. **Basic Singularity Function Definitions**
   - $u_{0}(t)=\delta(t)$
   - $u_{-1}(t)=u(t)$ (unit step function)
   - $u_{-2}(t)$: unit ramp function
4. **Singularity Function Convolution Rule**
   $$u_{k}(t) * u_{l}(t)=u_{k+l}(t)$$

What is $w(t)$ if the input is such that $y(t)$, the output of system A, is $a y_{1}(t)+b y_{2}(t)$ with $a$, $b$ constants?
2.  Suppose an input $x_{1}(t)$ produces $y_{1}(t)$ as system A output. What is $w(t)$ if $x(t)$ is such that $y(t)=y_{1}(t-\tau)$?
3.  Is system B an LTI system? Justify your answer.

### P5.7
Consider the three discrete-time signals shown in Figure P5.7.

> **Figure P5.7**
> $x[n]$: amplitude 2; $y[n]$: $n$ range 0; $w[n]$: $n$ range 0,1

1.  Verify the distributive law of convolution:
    $$(x+w) * y=(x * y)+(w * y)$$
2.  You may have noticed a similarity between the convolution operation and multiplication, but they are not equivalent. Verify that
    $$(x * y) \cdot w \neq x *(y \cdot w)$$

### P5.8

1.  $$\frac{d y(t)}{d t}=x(t) * \frac{d h(t)}{d t}=\frac{d x(t)}{d t} * h(t)$$
2.  $$y(t)=\left(\int_{-\infty}^{t} x(\tau) d \tau\right) * h'(t)$$
3.  $$y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{t}\left[x'(\tau) * h(\tau)\right] d \tau$$
4.  $$y(t)=x'(t) * \int_{-\infty}^{t} h(\tau) d \tau$$

### P5.9
Determine if each of the following statements concerning LTI systems is true or false. Justify your answers.
1.  If $h(t)$ is the impulse response of an LTI system and $h(t)$ is periodic and nonzero, the system is unstable.
2.  The inverse of a causal LTI system is always causal.
3.  If $|h[n]| ≤K$ for each $n$, where $K$ is a given number, then the LTI system with $h[n]$ as its impulse response is stable.
4.  If a discrete-time LTI system has an impulse response $h[n]$ of finite duration, the system is stable.
5.  If an LTI system is causal, it is stable.
6.  The cascade of a noncausal LTI system with a causal one is necessarily noncausal.
7.  A continuous-time LTI system is stable if and only if its step response $s(t)$ is absolutely integrable, i.e.,
    $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}|s(t)| d t<\infty$$
8.  A discrete-time LTI system is causal if and only if its step response $s[n]$ is zero for $n<0$

### P5.10
In Section 3.7 of the text we characterized the unit doublet through the equation
$$x(t) * u_{1}(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x(t-\tau) u_{1}(\tau) d \tau=x'(t) \tag{P5.10-1}$$
for any signal $x(t)$. From this equation we derived the fact that
$$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} g(\tau) u_{1}(\tau) d \tau=-g'(0) \tag{P5.10-2}$$

1.  Show that eq. (P5.10-2) is an equivalent characterization of $u_{1}(t)$ by showing that eq. (P5.10-2) implies eq. (P5.10-1). [Hint: Fix $t$ and define the signal $g(\tau)=x(t-\tau)$]
    Thus we have seen that characterizing the unit impulse or unit doublet by how it behaves under convolution is equivalent to characterizing how it behaves under integration when multiplied by an arbitrary signal $g(t)$. In fact, as indicated in Section 3.7 of the text, the equivalence of these operational definitions holds for all signals and in particular for all singularity functions.
2.  Let $f(t)$ be a given signal. Show that
    $$f(t)u_{1}(t)=f(0)u_{1}(t)-f'(0)\delta (t)$$
    by showing that both have the same operational definitions.
3.  Determine the value of
    $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) u_{2}(\tau) d \tau$$
4.  Find an expression for $f(t) u_{2}(t)$ analogous to that considered in part (b) for $f(t) u_{1}(t)$

### P5.11
Consider the cascade of two systems H and G as shown in Figure P5.11.

> **Figure P5.11**
> System block diagram: System H → System G (cascaded)

1.  If H and G are both LTI causal systems, prove that the overall system is causal.
2.  If H and G are both stable systems, show that the overall system is stable.

### P5.12
Find the combined impulse response of the LTI system in Figure P5.12. Recall that $x(t) * h(t) * h^{-1}(t)=x(t)$

> **Figure P5.12**
> System block diagram: Input $x(t)$ → Components $h_1, h_2, h_2, h_2^{-1}, h_2, h_1, h_2^{-1}$ → Output $y(t)$

### P5.13
Find the necessary and sufficient condition on the impulse response $h[n]$ such that for any input $x[n]$,
$$max \{|x[n]|\} \geq max \{|y[n]|\},$$
where $y[n]=x[n] * h[n]$
