    $$y(t)=\sin \pi t$$
    Show that \(z(t)=x(t) y(t)\) is periodic, and write \(z(t)\) as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials. That is, find a number \(T\) and complex numbers \(c_{k}\) such that
    $$z(t)=\sum_{k} c_{k} e^{j k(2 \pi / T) t}$$

### P2.10
In this problem we explore several of the properties of even and odd signals.

    $$x_{e}[n]=E v\{x[n]\}, x_{o}[n]=O d\{x[n]\}$$
    Show that
    $$\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} x^{2}[n]=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} x_{e}^{2}[n]+\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} x_{o}^{2}[n]$$
4.  Although parts (a)-(c) have been stated in terms of discrete-time signals, the analogous properties are also valid in continuous time. To demonstrate this, show that
    $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x^{2}(t) d t=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x_{e}^{2}(t) d t+\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x_{o}^{2}(t) d t$$
    where \(x_{e}(t)\) and \(x_{o}(t)\) are, respectively, the even and odd parts of \(x(t)\)

### P2.11
Let \(x(t)\) be the continuous-time complex exponential signal \(x(t)=e^{j \omega_{0} t}\) with fundamental frequency \(\omega_{0}\) and fundamental period \(T_{0}=2 \pi / \omega_{0}\). Consider the discrete-time signal obtained by taking equally spaced samples of \(x(t)\). That is, \(x[n]=x(n T)=e^{j \omega_{0} n T}\)
1.  Show that \(x[n]\) is periodic if and only if \(T / T_{0}\) is a rational number, that is, if and only if some multiple of the sampling interval exactly equals a multiple of the period \(x(t)\)
2.  Suppose that \(x[n]\) is periodic, that is, that
    $$\frac{T}{T_{0}}=\frac{p}{q}$$
    where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers. What are the fundamental period and fundamental frequency of \(x[n]\)? Express the fundamental frequency as a fraction of \(\omega_{0} T\)
3.  Again assuming that \(T / T_{0}\) satisfies the above equation, determine precisely how many periods of \(x(t)\) are needed to obtain the samples that form a single period of \(x[n]\)

## Optional Problems
### P3.8
In this problem we illustrate one of the most important consequences of the properties of linearity and time invariance. Specifically, once we know the response of a linear system or of a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system to a single input or the responses to several inputs, we can directly compute the responses to many other input signals.
1.  Consider an LTI system whose response to the signal \(x_{1}(t)\) in Figure P3.8-1(a) is the signal \(y_{1}(t)\) illustrated in Figure P3.8-1(b). Determine and sketch carefully the response of the system to the input \(x_{2}(t)\) depicted in Figure P3.8-1(c).

3.  Suppose that a second LTI system has the following output \(y(t)\) when the input is the unit step \(x(t)=u(t)\):
    $$y(t)=e^{-t} u(t)+u(-1-t)$$
    Determine and sketch the response of this system to the input \(x(t)\) shown in Figure P3.8-1(e).
4.  Suppose that a particular discrete-time linear (but possibly not time-invariant) system has the responses \(y_{1}[n]\), \(y_{2}[n]\), and \(y_{3}[n]\) to the input signals \(x_{1}[n]\), \(x_{2}[n]\), and \(x_{3}[n]\) respectively, as illustrated in Figure P3.8-2(a). If the input to this system is \(x[n]\) as illustrated in Figure P3.8-2(b), what is the output \(y[n]\)?
    > **Figure P3.8-2**
    > (a) \(x_1[n]\), \(y_1[n]\): n range -1 to 3; \(x_2[n]\), \(y_2[n]\): n range 0 to 3; \(x_3[n]\), \(y_3[n]\): n range -1 to 3
    > (b) \(x[n]\): (follow original figure)
5.  If an LTI system has the response \(y_{1}[n]\) to the input \(x_{1}[n]\) as in Figure P3.8-2(a), what would its responses be to \(x_{2}[n]\) and \(x_{3}[n]\)?
6.  A particular linear system has the property that the response to \(t^{k}\) is \(\cos k t\). What is the response of this system to the inputs
    $$x_{1}(t)=\pi+6 t^{2}-47 t^{5}+\sqrt{e} t^{6}$$
    $$x_{2}(t)=\frac{1+t^{10}}{1+t^{2}}$$

### P3.9
1.  Consider a system with input \(x(t)\) and with output \(y(t)\) given by
    $$y(t)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} x(t) \delta(t-n T)$$
    (i) Is this system linear?
    (ii) Is this system time-invariant?
    For each part, if your answer is yes, show why this is so. If your answer is no, produce a counterexample.
2.  Suppose that the input to this system is \(x(t)=\cos 2 \pi t\). Sketch and label carefully the output \(y(t)\) for each of the following values of \(T: T=1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{12}\). All of your sketches should have the same horizontal and vertical scales.
3.  Repeat part (b) for \(x(t)=e^{t} \cos 2 \pi t\)

### P3.10
1.  Is the following statement true or false?
    The series interconnection of two linear, time-invariant systems is itself a linear, time-invariant system.
    Justify your answer.
2.  Is the following statement true or false?
    The series connection of two nonlinear systems is itself nonlinear.
    Justify your answer.
3.  Consider three systems with the following input-output relations:
    $$System 1: y[n]= \begin{cases}x[n / 2], & n \text{ even} \\ 0, & n \text{ odd} \end{cases}$$
    $$System 2: y[n]=x[n]+\frac{1}{2} x[n-1]+\frac{1}{4} x[n-2]$$
    $$System 3: y[n]=x[2 n]$$
    Suppose that these systems are connected in series as depicted in Figure P3.10. Find the input-output relation for the overall interconnected system. Is this system linear? Is it time-invariant?
    > **Figure P3.10**
    > \(x[n] \to System 1 \to System 2 \to System 3 \to y[n]\)
4.  Consider a second series interconnection of the form of Figure P3.10 where the three systems are specified by the following equations, with \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) real numbers:
    $$System 1: y[n]=x[-n]$$
    $$System 2: y[n]=a x[n-1]+b x[n]+c x[n+1]$$
    $$System 3: y[n]=x[-n]$$
    Find the input-output relation for the overall interconnected system. Under what conditions on the numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) does the overall system have each of the following properties?
    (i) The overall system is linear and time-invariant.
    (ii) The input-output relation of the overall system is identical to that of System 2.
    (iii) The overall system is causal.

### P3.11
Determine whether each of the following systems is linear and/or time-invariant. In each case, \(x[n]\) denotes the input and \(y[n]\) denotes the output. Assume that \(x[0]>0\)
1.  \(y[n]=x[n]+x[n-1]\)
2.  \(y[n]=x[n]+x[n-1]+x[0]\)

### P3.12
1.  Show that causality for a continuous-time linear system implies the following statement:
    For any time \(t_{0}\) and any input \(x(t)\) such that \(x(t)=0\) for \(t<t_{0}\), the corresponding output \(y(t)\) must also be zero for \(t<t_{0}\).
    The analogous statement can be made for discrete-time linear systems.
2.  Find a nonlinear system that satisfies this condition but is not causal.
3.  Find a nonlinear system that is causal but does not satisfy this condition.
4.  Show that invertibility for a discrete-time linear system is equivalent to the following statement:
    The only input that produces the output \(y[n]=0\) for all \(n\) is \(x[n]=0\) for all \(n\). The analogous statement is also true for continuous-time linear systems.
5.  Find a nonlinear system that satisfies the condition of part (d) but is not invertible.
